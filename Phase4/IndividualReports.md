## MartinPetkov

 * My most significant contribution to the code has been the error handling code on the backend:
    https://github.com/MartinPetkov/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/7ea52f6fad46d0bb2b8c39a000bb2d6c91d2eddd
    https://github.com/MartinPetkov/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/adafddfdaa7d18a99a7e77648732650deac49404
    https://github.com/MartinPetkov/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/04f42cb69c03fb664e4d4341e35b1efd039192b5
 * I also contributed greatly to writing the [Product.md](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/9c2888e2164c5ae3f3f237e83a9f04202b812f81), [Process.md](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/b80f43e508a70a40991a44244e1e4024edab109d) and [Architecture.md](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/1ee107aa97a1f9ed2b61034160e4846417c0e80a) files
 * During this project, I learned mainly how to write a backend in Python using Flask and how to interact using SQLAlchemy using the same. I also learned a lot more about the MVC pattern and how it gets used in practice, since our project followed it in a very typical fashion.
 * My main strengths as a team member are reliability and organization, as well as the willingness to learn new things. This project required me to learn and understand new technologies and concepts, and I tried to learn them on time.
 * My main weakness as a team member is lack of programming experience and lack of free time to program, as I wasn't able to dedicate enough time to the coding portion of the project, not as much as others have. This is somewhere I could improve, by spending more time on the coding.

## Marco Monaco (inve1)

* Main contribution: Designed and implemented most of the back end. See this [Commit](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/f75af7b8488f945a9378053bea57d52e3c3dea90) , and a few [subsequent](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commits/master/backend/flaskapp.py) ones on flaskapp.py and models.py
* Technical concept: Had not worked first hand with CORS before. Quite simple to set up, much more convenient than JSONP
* Strengths: Good experience on backend services and server administration allowed me to design a usable API and database models quickly so the frontend guys could use it early in the project. Hosted the backend on one of my servers so they wouldn't have to setup a flask environment
* Weakness: Was not able to attend all meetings, mostly because I'm working full time, although I made to most of them.

* My main contribution is coding calendar logic - features like filtering, putting subscriptions to calendar managing sidebar buttons and so on.
* Some cools things I found new for me:
    * forking github model that was proposed by inve1
    * Some style aspects of cadz7 code - specifically his resource/server/factory setup for backend communication

* I think that me and cadz7 are most experienced front-end developers on the team. We made sure everyone on the team is familliar with the tools. And provided support for people who had troubles setting up development environment on their computers. I and Rick finalized on frameworks and tools we were going to use in phase 1 planning. I also can say that I was very communicative - i was available on slack almost all the time and didn't hesitate to meet up in person if anyone is having problems with the code.  
* bad sides/mistakes: I was a bit impatient sometimes - and pushed code with some small bugs that are fixed with 1-2 lines of code.

My most significant contributions were:  

* Implementation of Events list where user can subscribe/un-subscribe to events  
https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/2cd881482d87fa26a56154a8c1df48f62b0cc2c1
* Setting up the event details view and refactoring code:  
https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/fd3778c173f53bbbef94b0cf136580c328ddef3a  
https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/818a5e96ba9f93fdd5576d9021a0b941be68eb52  
* Re-doing the Landing page and several UI improvements to the app.
https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/0e94264a6fc4825cc7eb61688b02de590b3685c0  
https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/f8be1d23d0c549ca5b2558568a4e3b407487cc92  
https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/5347b4a65a403e8ed43a91af34df7816c9da4799  

* I am experienced in Front-End/UI aspects of Web Apps and took responsibility to complete those tasks (Majority of CSS work)  
https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commits/master/frontend/app/styles/dashboard.css  
https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/blob/master/frontend/app/styles/main.css  

* I could have implemented more interesting and unique functionalities had the requirements been more stringent.  
Nonetheless, I am happy with the overall effort put in by the team.

## talesgames

 * My most significant contrubution was the design the the front page of our web app in general
 * While working on our web app, I learned about scrum, tools like trello and slack (https://trello.com/) (https://slack.com/), and learning to use bootstrap, which can create good loking layouts (http://getbootstrap.com/)
 * My main contributions to the project were helping design the app layout. Even without having a lot of prigraming skill, I manage to help develop clean layouts, and to use bootstrap and photoshop to design and create a good user experience.
 * I had some comunications problens. While I was present in all the group meeting, somethimes I did not check my e-mail and slack, losing track of the project, and getting behind the app updates. For a next time, I will make sure to always be updated with the last version of the project, and to ask help if I fell behind.

## g2huda

* My most significant contribution was the design and implementation of the create-event and detail-event page
(https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/b56e87d5d416d6af499f4be728b9af1e030df6e4, https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/fbdc160e4e9ad2de9bc8e815b65d70a501641790, https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/106924b83c0c5a4b8c36eb81a6f57c034e827308). I color coded the subjects/events in the calendar( https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/aca9400d4cdc450ce55050409ed7e76e547cd2bf). I also added/adjusted the subscription and delete button for the detail-event page to be more functional(https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/1d4767e1173e3d7ec57392bda40b527e1d70962c).
* While working on our web app, I have learned about flask, json, and how to connect the server with the backend. I now have a better knowledge about javascripting, CSS as well as python.
* I am an experienced javascript/CSS coder, I have helped my team with making our app look more appealing. I always tested my teammates codes and I have informed them about the bugs that I have found(https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/issues/65).
* I could put more details in my commits - I have made multiple commits without giving enough information. I also could learn more about web apps ie(flask)- it is time consuming to start coding without having enough knowledge.

## kitsunemimi

 * My most significant contribution was the design and implementation of the landing page:  
    https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/75a9cb713571374f8d2e51259d8f56f730d3cf4d  
    https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/4af3b890b96177e75c403ff316ba400b3d5aba26  
    https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/da18dccbfad7f127df67dc061c8b3008abf13035  
    https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/74e4fd1df08bb67e16e24f7993f37ccf8fb8fd4f
 * I basically learned html in a couple of days. I learned that sometimes it's difficult to work within the constraints of a styled site and that making an individual page with unique styling will require some workarounds to avoid messing up other pages. I also learned about the nuances with bower/grunt and that it's pretty powerful for building web apps smoothly.
 * My main strengths lie in general and applied design. I helped with the overall design direction for the project along with Tales during the initial phases of the project, and I contributed entirely to the design of the landing page.
 * I generally don't cope very well with modifying and adjusting other people's code and I fell behind in the project quickly after it started moving in Phase 2 without any code of my own. This problem could be averted if the project requirements had enough breadth for everyone to occupy their own domain, or I could use some more experience with coding in a group environment.

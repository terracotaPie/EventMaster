# Process
## Tools and Conventions That We Used, and Why
These are some of the tools and techniques that we used:
- Slack for communication
- No daily meetings
- Fork flow, everyone has their own repository and creates pull requests
- Trello board and GitHub issues to keep track of tasks
- Planning meetings, taken from Scrum, every week after lecture
- Dividing team into backend-frontend-design
- Assigning priorities to tasks
- Scrum master to manage team
- Product backlog to keep track of roadmap 
- Review meetings
- Kanban board (screenshot in a file in this repo
- Linking GitHub commits to Slack messages
- Code sessions near the due dates for phases, to make sure everyone is on the same page

## Tools and Conventions That We Didn't Use, and Why
- Daily reporting of progress
- Retrospectives
- Product owner
- Diagrams for code
- Going through specific software design processes
- Regular reviews
- Sprints and burndown charts (we somewhat used them, but not very strictly)

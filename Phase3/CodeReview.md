## Reviewer : MartinPetkov

* I discovered that the backend code did not create debug logs (https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/issues/28) so I added them and had the server save them in a local file (https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/pull/42)
* I found that the API endpoints he wrote were very elegant, especially the validation decorator for GET requests (https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/3aeeeaa3c40988ffc70b1d06df0eb2766414ab7d), but I also found that there wasn't much error handling, so I added it (https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/pull/17)
* I thought his code for handling repeated events in the notifications was good; it's simple and easy to understand ().

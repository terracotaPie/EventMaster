## Choosing the Project
We chose the option of making a time management tool for university students.

We chose this project because it is something that can be personally useful to us and because it is easier to do it well since it is simpler. Several members had ideas on how to extend it and make it proactive instead of just a static calendar, so that gave us some room for creativity. Some members were against it and preferred to do the first project idea, as they found it more interesting. We asked everyone for their reasons for and against each project and eventually decided to compromise and go with what the majority of the team wanted to work on. Most members also wanted to work on a web app instead of an Android project, so the third app was not a feasible choice.

## Two Personas
* Jane Doe
  * Jane Doe is a first year student new to UofT: She needs a convenient course management tool that contains her time table, shared study resources and best places to study on campus. She is used to the regular schedule of high school and would like a tool to help her adapt to her irregular timetable in university. She is worried about forgetting to go to classes or tutorials that she only has once a week per class, and she is afraid she might miss deadlines that are far away and aren't mentioned by the profs in class. She lives on residence, so traveling isn't a time-consuming thing.
* Sam Smith
  * Sam Smith is a fourth year student at UofT: He needs a time management tool that integrates with this courses to remind him of upcoming deadlines. He is used to the irregular schedule but is busy with a part-time job, a research project and several clubs that he's part of. He would like a time management tool to help him remember all his deadlines and assignments, since he has a lot on his mind most of the time and would have a hard time remembering himself. He lives close to campus with friends, so commuting takes him some time. He wants the tool to also help him prioritize which assignments to work on, to make sure he doesn't fall behind.

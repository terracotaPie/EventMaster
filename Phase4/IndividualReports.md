# Individual Reports

## Name (GitHub username)

Here is an example of a fake report, just to give you an idea of the format we are expecting.
We would like you to be concise yet informative.

 * My most significant contrubution was the design and implementation of Component X (links to relevant and interesting source-files/commits/issues).
 * While working on our Android app (and then later in class), I learned about adapters (links to relevant and interesting source-files/commits/issues).
 * I am always helping my teammates - I am the most experienced coder on the team, and I helped other teammates set up their development environment, and get up to speed with the tools we've used (give examples of specific tools).
 * I could keep people more informed of what I am doing - I made a few large commits that conflicted with everybody else's code, and merging everything wasted a lot of our time.

* My most significant contribution was the design and implementation of the create-event and detail-event page
(https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/b56e87d5d416d6af499f4be728b9af1e030df6e4, https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/fbdc160e4e9ad2de9bc8e815b65d70a501641790, https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/106924b83c0c5a4b8c36eb81a6f57c034e827308). I color coded the subjects/events in the calendar( https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/aca9400d4cdc450ce55050409ed7e76e547cd2bf). I also added/adjusted the subscription and delete button for the detail-event page to be more functional(https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/1d4767e1173e3d7ec57392bda40b527e1d70962c).
 * While working on our web app, I have learned about flask, json, and how to connect the server with the backend. I now have a better knowledge about javascripting, CSS as well as python.
 * I am an experienced javascript/CSS coder, I have helped my team with making our app look more appealing. I always tested my teammates codes and I have informed them about the bugs that I have found(https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/issues/65).
 * I could put more details in my commits - I have made multiple commits without giving enough information. I also could learn more about web apps ie(flask)- it is time consuming to start coding without having enough knowledge.

## Comments

* Product.md is good. I deducted a mark because you don't specifically mention
  what you developed in Phase 2. Also, some of the descriptions are unclear --
  you say users can create their own schedules, but then say "Schedules cannot
  be created for arbitrary things". It's unclear if you mean that you limit
  students to creating schedules for school-related events. In addition, it's
  unclear why you need "groups" -- if one schedule lists
  classes/tutorial/labs/assignments/etc., why do I need a collection of
  schedules for a single class?

* Process.md is good. Your stats concerning how many commits you used for
  different subsystems, as well as how you used branches, were insightful. I
  would have liked, however, some links to specific
  commits/issues/etc., so I could see examples of how you used the processes
  you described.

* Your presentation didn't have good flow -- you showed me various features of
  the application, but they weren't presented in a logical way that told me why
  they produced a useful product. You handled all questions well, however --
  you had a good understanding of what bottlenecks loading all events entailed.

* You accomplished most of what you listed as your Phase 2 goals. I deducted a
  mark because one of your user stories involved adding events, which you only
  had support for in the backend.

* I like that you gave explicit instructions on how to get the app running. You
  made good use of Angular and Flask to create a well-structured, maintainable
  app.

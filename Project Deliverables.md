## Choosing the Project
We chose the option of making a time management tool for university students.

We chose this project because it is something that can be personally useful to us and because it is easier to do it well since it is simpler. Several members had ideas on how to extend it and make it proactive instead of just a static calendar, so that gave us some room for creativity. Some members were against it and preferred to do the first project idea, as they found it more interesting. We asked everyone for their reasons for and against each project and eventually decided to compromise and go with what the majority of the team wanted to work on. Most members also wanted to work on a web app instead of an Android project, so the third app was not a feasible choice.

## Two Personas

## User Stories
* [persona 1] wants to be able to see all his lecture and tutorial times, as well as all due dates in one place, so that he doesn't have to check multiple websites to find this info
* [persona 1] wants to be able to add custom times and due dates in case his professors do not post these times online
* [persona 1] wants the app to automatically update information about lecture times, tutorial times and due dates when it is available online
* [persona 1] wants to be reminded when something is due so that he won't forget to do it
* [persona 1] wants to be able to validate user-generated data against the opinions of other classmates
* [persona 2] wants to get some kind of notifications when any information has been created or updated
* [persona 2] need to be able to find times, due dates and tutorials for a specific lecture

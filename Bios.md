**Martin Petkov**  
I am a third year computer science specialist student, with a focus in computer systems. I'm most interested in computer networks and security, and in terms of programming I prefer backend to frontend. I was born in Bulgaria but I've been in Canada for 10 years now. Besides computers, I like fencing, archery and tennis, I play bass, and I like board games a lot more than video games.

**Rakshit Shukla**    
I'm Rakshit, or Rick as most people call me, and am in my third year doing a specialist in CS.  
I've been programming since grade 10 and my expertise lies in Front-End Web and Mobile Development.  
I have interned at 2 startups in the past and I hope to be a founder of a Web Development Consultancy one day.  
Apart from CS, I take time to do weight training 4-5 times a week and I believe a healthy body gives way to a healthy mind.

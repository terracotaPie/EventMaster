## Reviewer : MartinPetkov

* I discovered that the backend code did not create debug logs (https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/issues/28) so I added them and had the server save them in a local file (https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/pull/42).
 * I thought the fact that his merging of our commits and pull requests was well done, we've almost entirely avoided conflicts so far in the project (https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commits/master?author=inve1)
 * I thought his code for handling repeated events in the notifications was good; it's simple and easy to understand ().

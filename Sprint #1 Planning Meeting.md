**Issues for Sprint #1**  
1.	Create all the database models
2.	Create the basic login page where users can sign up or log in.
3.	Create the dashboard/home page
4.	Allow user to add custom times and due dates
5.	Define the API endpoints
6.	Create basic templates for the web app
7.	Make sure the models are usable and properly implemented
8.	Design the views
9.	Code the views
10.	Implement a simple search  

**Other Notes**
-	We should not just leave issues for people to pick up, because most likely they won’t take it
-	We should use Flask because it’s simpler, especially since the backend will not be generating pages
-	Most team members showed up
-	We decided our workflow
-	We decided to use square brackets [F] and [B] to distinguish tasks between frontend and backend
-	Yeomn will be used for web app templates
-	There was much discussion on whether events should be loose or not
-	We decided to use tags for events, since it makes grouping easier, since it’ll be dynamic
-	There was a lot of discussion
-	We decided which part of the project people will want to work on (i.e. frontend, backend, little of both)
-	We should use CDF or Heroku to host our server

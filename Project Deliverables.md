## Choosing the Project
We chose the option of making a time management tool for university students.

We chose this project because it is something that can be personally useful to us and because it is easier to do it well since it is simpler. Several members had ideas on how to extend it and make it proactive instead of just a static calendar, so that gave us some room for creativity. Some members were against it and preferred to do the first project idea, as they found it more interesting. We asked everyone for their reasons for and against each project and eventually decided to compromise and go with what the majority of the team wanted to work on. Most members also wanted to work on a web app instead of an Android project, so the third app was not a feasible choice.

## Two Personas
* Hari Seldon  
  * Hari Seldon is statistics Professor at University of Toronto. He mostly teaches 1st and 2nd year courses. Teaching Assistants are doing a really good job, thus he has a lot of free time. He has a lot of knowledge to share not only about the course's materials but also techniques on how to achieve academic success in his classes. He would love to share it, but there's no platform currently available. He thinks that info like good places to study, recommended time to be spent on certain task, common mistakes made by students is important.
* Jane Doe
  * Jane Doe is a first year student new to UofT: She needs a convenient course management tool that contains her time table, shared study resources and best places to study on campus.
* Sam Smith
  * Sam Smith is a second year student at UofT: He needs a time management tool that integrates with this courses to remind him of upcoming deadlines.

// Not sure if we should have a professor as a persona, as the tool is focussed for students.

// We should change the Professor persona, as your chalange is to have a instructor who is not willing to help.

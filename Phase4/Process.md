# Process
## Tools and Conventions That We Used, and Why
These are some of the tools and techniques that we used:
* We primarily used Slack for communication. We also exchanged phone numbers and added each other on facebook, but most communication was done through slack. We created several different targeted chats, such as one for the frontend, one for the next meetings, etc.. We used it often to tag specific people to ask targeted questions, and we linked our GitHub repos to it so that certain commits would show up as messages there, for everyone to see.
* We had no daily meetings as prescribed by Scrum. We found that we were too busy to schedule in meetings that often, so instead we found it easier to update the team through Slack and face-to-face communication during our real-life meetings.
* We followed the fork flow, where everyone created their own fork of the main repository and created pull requests to add code. All the pull requests were mainly managed by one team member, to centralize responsibility. Since all commits were visible to all team members, we unofficially reviewed code by looking at specific commits, rather than following a formal process. The fork model was chosen to keep the main repo less cluttered and to ensure that the code in the main repo is always complete and working.
* We subscribed each person to every other team member's fork, so that we are all aware of commits that the others make.
* We used a Trello board to simulate a Kanban board, and GitHub issues to keep track of tasks. GitHub issues was used primarily to link commits to tasks to people, while the Trello board was mainly used to track which state of the process tasks were in. The boards we used were "Tabled For Later," "Planning," "Development," "Bug Fixing and Validation" and "Production". We did not modify their initial values as described in the Phase 3 files, as we found them to be just right. A screenshot of our Kanban board from a week ago is in the repo.
* We had planning and update meetings every week after lecture, taken from Scrum.
* We divided the team into backend people, frontend people and design.
* We assignined priorities to tasks to be better able to determine which tasks to do and which ones to drop.
* We initally assigned a scrum master to manage the team and ensure that we followed the scrum process.
* We had review meetings near the deadlines for submissions, to make sure everyone was on the same page.

## Tools and Conventions That We Didn't Use, and Why
* We did not have daily reporting of progress. We found that to be cumbersome and most people were not able to update every day, or did not have anything significant to update people on every single day.
* We did not hold retrospectives at our review meetings. We felt that most of the time we were following the process well, and everything that needed to be resolved was brought up during the phase, not at the end.
* We did not have a proper product owner, though that was most likely due to the way the whole project was organized.
* We did not create diagrams for our code. We tried to keep it simple and understandable enough that it didn't need them.
* We didn't go through a specific software design process, we kind of just followed the MVC pattern and tried to keep the code simple.
* We didn't have regular code reviews. We just encouraged other teammates to look at people's code when they saw the commits, and make comments if appropriate.
* We didn't have proper sprints and burndown charts (we somewhat used them, but not very strictly). We found it too cumbersome to follow the Scrum process to this level of detail.

## Adaptations and Reasoning for Kanban and Scrum
We adapted Scrum by following and removing the elements described above. In most cases for removal, it was to keep our process simple and to fit the fact that most team members were not free every single day and did not code every single day.

## Did We Like Kanban or Scrum Better
We liked Kanban better. We found that Kanban suited our schedules better, because it allowed us to focus on the work to be done and to constantly keep things moving, instead of worrying about the pseudo-deadlines of Scrum sprints, which resulted mostly in sprinting near the end.

## Ideal Future Process For Our Team
Our ideal process would be something very similar to the one that we followed in this project. We would have weekly meetings in real life, we would meet to discuss important features and deadlines, we would follow something like Kanban, and we would still use the fork model with pull requests. We found very few issues with the model we had during this project, and would likely keep on using it.

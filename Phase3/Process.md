# Software Development Process

**General Kanban**  
The columns we used for our Kanban board ([Trello](https://trello.com/b/lYWiOAQ3/phase-3)):
 * Tabled for Later - WIP ∞
 * Planning - WIP 10
 * Development - WIP 3
 * Bug Fixing and Validation - WIP 5
 * Production - WIP ∞

We kept the limits the same throughout this phase, we found that we naturally limited ourselves to them while working.

We used the same GitHub issues as from previous phases, as we had created all of our planned user stories in the very beginning. We also added some new issues that came from our first planning meeting, and they followed the same format as before. That format was to have [F] and/or [B] in front of the issue name, and the description giving more details and possibly stating who else is working on the issue. We assigned issues the same way as in our Trello board, to keep things consistent.

**Opinion on Kanban vs. Scrum**  
During phase 3, we used some things from both Kanban and Scrum, not being too strict about either. We still had an initial planning meeting and regular talks, but also used the Kanban board and followed that instead of sprints. We felt that the board made it more convenient to access and work on tasks that weren't strictly assigned to you, and also allowed us to work on taks when time was available rather than being confined to timed phases. Our team in particular could not work every single day, so we worked in longer bursts on days that were more free, and Kanban complemented that well. Also, it was less confusing to assign specific tasks to people and the boards made it easy to see what needed work at any point. As a team we also could see continuous progress as tasks moved across the boards, which was better than what felt like lulls of unproductivity during scrum. Despite that, some team members felt that there wasn't significant difference between the two; our workflow stayed essentially the same, and the administrative overhead was minimal with both models.

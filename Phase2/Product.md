**TB Calendar Report**
This is a web application for keeping track of times for classes and due dates for assignments. A user has to make an account using a valid utoronto email, to ensure that only students use the service. A user can search for "groups", which are collections of schedules created by other users that describe when a class/tutorial/lab occurs, when assignments are due or when tests are happening, along with locations. Users can create their own schedules, but each schedule needs to be validated by other users, with the highest rated schedule for a group being the "official" one. Schedules cannot be created for arbitrary things, only for predefined events as described above. This allows students to have a reliable set of schedules corroborated by actual other students in their classes. Everything is displayed nicely in one simple dashboard with a calendar and a list of upcoming events. Future functionality will include alerts and other automatic updates.

**Martin Petkov**  
I am a third year computer science specialist student, with a focus in computer systems. I'm most interested in computer networks and security, and in terms of programming I prefer backend to frontend. I was born in Bulgaria but I've been in Canada for 10 years now. Besides computers, I like fencing, archery and tennis, I play bass, and I like board games a lot more than video games.

**Rakshit Shukla**    
I'm Rakshit, or Rick as most people call me, and am in my third year doing a specialist in CS.  
I've been programming since grade 10 and my expertise lies in Front-End Web and Mobile Development.  
I have interned at 2 startups in the past and I hope to be a founder of a Web Development Consultancy one day.  
Apart from CS, I take time to do weight training 4-5 times a week and I believe a healthy body gives way to a healthy mind.  

**Huda Fouda**   
My name is Huda. I lived in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Canada. Each country taught me different lessons in life and opened my eyes to various cultures. I have two sisters who I love and adore; we do everything together. In addition I have two cats and a dog that are very cute. My parents are the love of my life, and I can’t imagine making it this far without their constant support.
I used to be a piano teacher at the Ontario Conservatory of Music. I have expressed my love for music in mastering the art of the piano and entering many competitions. However, I decided to switch focus and switch an alternative passion for computer science. I am interested much in programming for games, and hope to get an opportunity to try it in the future. For now, I’m enjoying learning more about web developing through my extracurricular activity.

**Tales Mariano**
I am a forth year exchange computer science student, with focus in game design. I am from Brazil, and I have been studying in Uoft for one year. Outside coding, I have experience in design, animation, 3d modeling, psychology and screenplay. 

**Timur Borkhodoev**
My name is Timur, originally from Russia. After graduating from high school in Russia, at the age of 15 moved to Canada for higher education at U of T. Enjoy weight training and jogging. At this point of life very interested in web programming, but seriously considering investing time in one of perspective system programming language like Rust. Dream of working on a cs consulting startup. Heavily into anime, manga, sci-fi tv shows, isaac asimov and rock music. Whenever there's not much to do I resort to sport programming(codeforces.com).

**Harris Fok**
I'm Harris, and I'm a third year computer science specialist, with focus in game design. I was born and raised here in Toronto, so I guess that makes me the most boring in that respect among the other people here. I enjoy anime, games, and music, and thus I spend most of my free time on them. I've also spent way too much time obsessing over computer hardware and whatnot but nobody seems to ever care about those so whatever. I've started programming in Grade 11, though most of my programming has been related to school work so I still feel slightly inexperienced in the field - however I'm hoping to change that in my free time once I get a better hold on proper coding practice. I do happen to have a decent amount of experience with image editing though, and to a lesser extent, video editing as well.

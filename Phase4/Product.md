# Product
## Introduction
Our product is an online timetable app, intended to help student organize events and deadlines in one place to help them be more successful in school. It is collaborative, in that students can view the events that others have created and vote on which ones they believe are the most accurate ones, allowing them to quickly figure out what the correct information is for a course or club even when the teachers, TAs or club heads are not involved. The product also provides automatic notifcations for upcoming events, to make sure that the user does not miss a deadline or an assignment.

## Feature Set
Here is a list of some of the features we focused on:
 * Being able to create custom events when existing ones are not satisfactory, or they don't exist
 * Being able to subscribe to groups of events, such as all events for a class, to improve usability
 * Being able to upvote or downvote events to improve their reliability
 * Searching for events and seeing them in order of importance, based on how many people have subscribed to them, to easily see the most reliable information
 * Receiving automatic notifications (in a configurable period) that can be checked but are otherwise persistent, to make sure the user does not forget about any events
 * Can only sign up using a @mail.utoronto.ca email, to prevent crowding from non-student users

## How We Chose features
As the project went along, we started off by assuming that we wanted to do all features, then ranking them and focusing on the ones we felt were most fundamental to usability or to making our product stand out. The features listed above are some of the ones we felt were fundamental and would improve the product the most, along with things like having a good landing page, automatic colour coding of courses, and the ability to delete custom events. While much of decisions were made with importance in mind, we also regularly considered the complexity vs. time availability of team members and culled features that we knew we wouldn't be able to do in time, such as sending email reminders, updates when a course changes, or automatic mark estimations. We also took out having bios and avatars, as we felt that was extraneous and not worth our efforts while others were more pressing.

## Usage Scenario
This is a typical series of steps a user would go through:
 1. Go to the landing page at http://bulgariangrannieschewingseeds.oggettone.com/#/landing (apologies for the domain name)
 2. Sign up using a @mail.utoronto.ca email address
 3. Login
 4. Search for existing events OR create your own events OR subscribe to a group of events
 5. Watch them show up on your calendar
 6. Check the website frequently, to see when a notification pops up, letting you know about an upcoming event

## What Makes Our Product Unique
What makes our product unique is the fact that the events can be confirmed or disproved by others, allowing you to leverage information and knowledge from all of the people in the class, improving the overall reliability of the events. Another thing that makes it unique is the fact that you can only sign up using an @mail.utoronto.ca email, limiting it only to UofT students, ensuring that the people contributing are actual relevant students. In theory, this could be expanded to allow different types of email addresses specific to other schools, and the app itself would be limited to only users from those sets of emails.

## What we chose to Keep and Remove
The easiest way to see what we decided to remove is to compare the features described above with the list in our [Phase 1 plan](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/blob/master/Phase1/Project%20Deliverables.md). Other than what was mentioned, the following features were removed:
 * Being able to see study tips from other users
 * Profs having any involvement in the process (we realize it would have been a good idea, we just didn't have time to implement it, and it complicated everything else about the usage flow of the project)
 * Getting notifications for changes to events
 * Receiving notifications through email or SMS
 * Being reminded of the exact time and location of exam rooms
 * Creating bios and avatars
 * Seeing automatic mark estimations
 * Assigning priorities to events
 * Links to online syllabuses

Most of these features were removed due to lack of sufficient time to complete them well, as well as because some of them significantly complicated the usage of the product, and we wanted to keep it simple.

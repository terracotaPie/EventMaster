## MartinPetkov

 * My most significant contribution to the code has been the error handling code on the backend:
    https://github.com/MartinPetkov/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/7ea52f6fad46d0bb2b8c39a000bb2d6c91d2eddd

    https://github.com/MartinPetkov/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/04f42cb69c03fb664e4d4341e35b1efd039192b5
 * I also contributed greatly to writing the [Product.md](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/9c2888e2164c5ae3f3f237e83a9f04202b812f81), [Process.md](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/b80f43e508a70a40991a44244e1e4024edab109d) and [Architecture.md](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/1ee107aa97a1f9ed2b61034160e4846417c0e80a) files
 * During this project, I learned mainly how to write a backend in Python using Flask and how to interact using SQLAlchemy using the same. I also learned a lot more about the MVC pattern and how it gets used in practice, since our project followed it in a very typical fashion.
 * My main strengths as a team member are reliability and organization, as well as the willingness to learn new things. This project required me to learn and understand new technologies and concepts, and I tried to learn them on time.
 * My main weakness as a team member is lack of programming experience and lack of free time to program, as I wasn't able to dedicate enough time to the coding portion of the project, not as much as others have. This is somewhere I could improve, by spending more time on the coding.

 * My most significant contrubution was the design the the front page of our web app in general
 * While working on our web app, I learned about scrum, and tools like trello and slack (https://trello.com/) (https://slack.com/)

* My most significant contribution was the design and implementation of the create-event and detail-event page
(https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/b56e87d5d416d6af499f4be728b9af1e030df6e4, https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/fbdc160e4e9ad2de9bc8e815b65d70a501641790, https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/106924b83c0c5a4b8c36eb81a6f57c034e827308). I color coded the subjects/events in the calendar( https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/aca9400d4cdc450ce55050409ed7e76e547cd2bf). I also added/adjusted the subscription and delete button for the detail-event page to be more functional(https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/commit/1d4767e1173e3d7ec57392bda40b527e1d70962c).
* While working on our web app, I have learned about flask, json, and how to connect the server with the backend. I now have a better knowledge about javascripting, CSS as well as python.
* I am an experienced javascript/CSS coder, I have helped my team with making our app look more appealing. I always tested my teammates codes and I have informed them about the bugs that I have found(https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team12-repo/issues/65).
* I could put more details in my commits - I have made multiple commits without giving enough information. I also could learn more about web apps ie(flask)- it is time consuming to start coding without having enough knowledge.
